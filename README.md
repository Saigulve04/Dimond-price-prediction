# 💎 Diamond Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the prices of diamonds using various regression models, with a focus on identifying the most accurate and efficient algorithm. The dataset includes features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions that influence the price of a diamond.

## 🧠 Models Implemented

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

## ✅ Best Model

The **Random Forest Regressor** achieved the highest accuracy with an **R² score of 97%**, making it the most reliable model for this prediction task.

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Diamond Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds)
- Total rows: 53,940
- Features:  
  - **Numerical**: `carat`, `depth`, `table`, `x`, `y`, `z`  
  - **Categorical**: `cut`, `color`, `clarity`

## 🔧 Features & Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Label encoding for categorical variables
   - Feature scaling (if necessary)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Distribution plots
   - Box plots for outlier detection

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Train-test split
   - Model fitting
   - Evaluation using R², MAE, MSE, and RMSE

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
   - Cross-validation to reduce overfitting

5. **Feature Importance**
   - Identified key features influencing the price using feature importance scores
